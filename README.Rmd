The goal of shinymodels is to launch a Shiny app given tidymodels' tuning or resampling results. The main goal is to make it easier to explore tidymodels results.

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of shinymodels from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:~~

``` r
install.packages("shinymodels") ## not yet
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/shinymodels")
```

## Example

Start by tuning or fitting to resampling folds, using tune functions like `fit_resamples()` or `tune_bayes()`.

```{r example}
library(shinymodels)
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer()
library(doMC)
registerDoMC(cores = 8)

set.seed(6735)
folds <- vfold_cv(mtcars, v = 5)

car_rec <-
  recipe(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

svm_mod <-
  svm_rbf(cost = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("kernlab") %>%
  set_mode("regression")

# Use a space-filling design with 7 points
set.seed(3254)
svm_res <- tune_bayes(svm_mod, car_rec, resamples = folds, initial = 7, iter = 3,
                     control = control_bayes(save_pred = TRUE, verbose = TRUE))
svm_res
```

Apply the launcher function `explore()` on the `tune_` object to launch a Shiny app with the plots related to the model. 
```r
explore(svm_res)
```
You should see a Shiny app that looks like this:

Use the Shiny app to explore the model and detect any outliers or problematic observations.
